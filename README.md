# Nameless Adventure
This is a quick text-based adventure game made in Prolog for a Uni assignment.
It was made following the 
[Amzi! Inc Guide](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/a1start.php) guide, an amazing resource to learn Prolog.

There's also the report I wrote for the assignment, its in spanish, maybe when I get bored I'll translate it and write it here.
